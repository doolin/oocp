# Object Oriented C Programming

Yes, it can be done.  You really can write c in object-oriented style.
You're not going to get all the bells and whistles of C++ or Java,
but if you need to tidy up a well-defined c library, there techniques
can be enormously useful.

The type of structure where this works best is (again) fairly small
and well-defined, with a shallow, unambiguous inheritance, and 
where polymorphism isn't overly critical. 

This is not a very high priority project, but I'm happy to answer 
questions.
